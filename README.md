# Props React Exercise

1a. Create a function component called Exercise<br>

1b. Add the export line at the bottom of the file

2a. Inside the Exercise function component, use the RETURN keyword with parentheses to have the Exercise function component return two h1s with the following text in each. First h1: "Great". Second h1: "Not Great". (HINT: Remember only one parent/top element can be returned from a component)

2b. Open the App.js file and add the necessary import line at the top of the file that allows the Exercise component to be used in the App.js file

2c. Inside the return for the App component, pass in the Exercise component so it will render to the browser (AKA. Display in the browser)

3a. Below the Exercise component in the App component, pass in another Exercise component with the following props and values:
1st Prop: Set the name of the prop to "good". Set the value to the following string value "Awesome"
2nd Prop: Set the name of the prop to "bad". Set the value to the following string value "Terrible"

3b. Back to the Exercise.js file, use destructuring in the Exercise function component to set each prop (AKA Property) to the name of the property.

3c. In the Exercise function component, replace the text of "Great" in the first h1 with the "good" property/parameter. Also, replace the text of "Not Great" in the 2nd h1 with the "bad" property/parameter. (HINT: Remember to use brackets {}) (NOTE: If this is done correctly, then "Awesome" & "Terrible" should display in the browser)

3d. Set the following preset values for the "good" and "bad" properties/parameters...<br>
Preset value for good: "Great"<br>
Preset value for bad: "Not Great"<br>
(NOTE: If this is done correctly, then "Great" & "Not Great" should display in the browser above "Awesome" & "Terrible")<br>

Bonus<br>
6a. Create a function component called Bonus.

6b. Inside the Bonus function component use the return keyword to have it return an h1 with the text of "Bonus Component"

6c. Use the Bonus component in the Exercise component so it will display after the two h1 elements on the webpage

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
